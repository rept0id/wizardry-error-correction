Author : Rantouan Achmet rad@simplecode.gr

The purpose of this Git is to experiment with and discover the secrets of error correction codes.

## History

Error correction was **one of the first algorithmic fields to spark human interest** !

Between the ***7th and 10th centuries CE***, Jewish scribes formalized the `Numerical Masorah` to ensure accurate Hebrew Bible reproduction.

In the early ***1950s***, `Richard W. Hamming` created his well-known error-correcting code at Bell Labs because he was frustrated with errors in punched card systems. 

***Today***, we still benefit from Hamming's workâ€”modern ECC RAM, which uses a version of Hamming's code, helps keep important data like telecommunications and banking transactions safe and reliable on servers.
